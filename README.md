This is a set of notes on _Mathematics_ necessary for an _Aspiting mathematician_. The notes are under preparation.
The following is a broad list of topics to be covered, as well as their development stage:

1. Set Theory (being developed)
2. Category Theory (not started as yet)
3. Linear Algebra (not started as yet)
4. Real Analysis (not started as yet)
5. Topology (general and point free) (not started as yet)
6. Rings of contiuous functions (not started as yet)

The order of placement of the above material do not indicate their pedagogical dependence but the order in which they are
going to be completed. Since the notes are hyperlinked set of web pages, as for the reader he/she can access them in whichever
order he/she requires, for the unknown terms would have internal links to the requisite page and so on... 

The notes are largely developed by myself; however, active criticism from readers would be greatly welcome and appreciated --- they
would certainly help in making the notes better and more accessible to many. The help shall obviously be acknowledged within the notes
themselves. Furthermore, some pictures of memorable person have been taken from the internet; please let me know if further accreditation
of sources should be included. 

With the hope of hearing some criticisms and suggestions from the readers...
